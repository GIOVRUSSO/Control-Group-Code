Author of the scripts and figures: Émiland Garrabé (University of Salerno).

This repository gathers the full-size figures and plots of the PMFs for the sources and target behavior featured in Section VI of the work: "On the design of autonomous agents from multiple data sources" by E. Garrabé and G. Russo.

The files are the following:

* The files 'Source1.pdf', 'Source2.pdf' and 'Source3.pdf' contain bar plots of the PMFs corresponding to the behavior sources 1 to 3;
* The file 'target_behavior.pdf' contains bar plots for the PMFs corresponding to the target behavior;
* The file 'fig1.jpg' is the first figure of the paper, showing a connected car navigating a grid with behaviors from different services. The figure describes the connected cars scenario considered in the paper;
* The file 'fig2.jpg' is the second figure of the paper, displaying sampled routes for the target behavior (top left), sources (top right) and the reward for case 2 (bottom);
* The file 'fig3_case1.jpg' reports the panels for the top half of the third figure of the paper;
* The file 'fig3_case2.jpg' reports the panels for the bottom half of the third figure of the paper.

The experiments were carried out by Émiland Garrabé and the code can be made available upon request (send an email to egarrabe@unisa.it and giovarusso@unisa.it).
