This repository gathers the full-size figures and plots of the PMFs for the sources and target behavior featured in Section VI of the work: "On the design of autonomous agents from multiple data sources" by E. Garrabé and G. Russo.

The files are the following:

* The files 'Source1.pdf', 'Source2.pdf' and 'Source3.pdf' contain bar plots of the PMFs corresponding to the behavior sources 1 to 3
* The file 'target_behavior.pdf' contains bar plots for the PMFs corresponding to the target behavior
* The file 'fig1.jpg' is the first figure of the paper, showing a connected car navigating a grid with behaviors from different services
* The file 'fig2.jpg' is the second figure of the paper, displaying sampled routes for the target behavior (top left), sources (top right) and the reward for case 2 (bottom)
* The file 'fig3_case1.jpg' is the first half of the third figure of the paper, with the agent PMFs for case 1 (left) and the route sampled from these PMFs (right)
* The file 'fig3_case2.jpg' is the first half of the third figure of the paper, with the agent PMFs for case 2 (left) and the route sampled from these PMFs (right)

The experiments were carried out by Émiland Garrabé and the code can be made available upon request.
