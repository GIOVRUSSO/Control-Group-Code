This repository gathers the full-size figures and plots of the PMFs for the sources and target behavior featured in Section VI of the work: "On the design of autonomous agents from multiple data sources" by E. Garrabé and G. Russo. This includes the additional figures from the extended version of the paper available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02020

The files are the following:

* The files 'Source1.pdf', 'Source2.pdf' and 'Source3.pdf' contain bar plots of the PMFs corresponding to the behavior sources 1 to 3;
* The file 'target_behavior.pdf' contains bar plots for the PMFs corresponding to the target behavior;

Figures featured in the journal version of the paper:
* The file 'fullfig_scaled.jpg' is the only figure of the journal paper, displaying sampled routes for the target behavior (top left), sources (top right), the agent's sampled route for experimental case 2 (bottom left) and the pmfs from which this route was sampled (bottom right);

Figures features in the extended version of the paper:
* The file 'fig1.jpg' is the first figure of the extended paper, showing a connected car navigating a grid with behaviors from different services. The figure describes the connected cars scenario considered in the paper;
* The file 'grids_rwd.jpg' is the second figure of the extended paper, displaying sampled routes for the target behavior (top left), sources (top right) and the reward for case 2 (bottom);
* The file 'res_case1.jpg' reports the panels for the top half of the third figure of the extended paper;
* The file 'res_case2.jpg' reports the panels for the bottom half of the third figure of the extended paper.

The experiments were carried out by Émiland Garrabé and the code can be made available upon request (send an email to egarrabe@unisa.it and giovarusso@unisa.it).
