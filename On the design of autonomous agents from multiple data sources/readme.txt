This repository gathers the full-size figures and plots of the PMFs for the sources and target behavior featured in Section VI of the work: "On the design of autonomous agents from multiple data sources" by E. Garrabé and G. Russo. This includes the additional figures from the extended version of the paper available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02020

The files are the following:

* The files 'Source1.pdf', 'Source2.pdf' and 'Source3.pdf' contain bar plots of the PMFs corresponding to the behavior sources 1 to 3;
* The file 'target_behavior.pdf' contains bar plots for the PMFs corresponding to the target behavior;

Figures featured in the journal version of the paper:
* The file 'fullfig_scaled.jpg' is the only figure of the journal paper, displaying sampled routes for the target behavior (top left), sources (top right), the agent's sampled route for experimental case 2 (bottom left) and the pmfs from which this route was sampled (bottom right);

Other figures:
* The file 'fig1.jpg' graphically illustrates the use case we considered in the paper. The figure shows a connected car navigating within a grid. The car has access to different services. The figure describes the connected cars scenario considered in the paper;
* The file 'grids_rwd.jpg' reports sampled routes for the target behavior (top left), sources (top right) and the reward for case 2 (bottom);
* The file 'res_case1.jpg' reports the output of the crowdsourcing algorithm documented in our panel when the agent has no intrinsic rewards. As detailed in the paper, the car tracks the target behavior;
* The file 'res_case2.jpg' reports the output of the crowdsourcing algorithm when the agent has the non-zero reward used in the paper. The car behavior will now be different from the one of the target.

These figures are not contained in the published version of the paper and are instead contained in its extended version (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02020).

The experiments were carried out by Émiland Garrabé and the code can be made available upon request (send an email to egarrabe@unisa.it and giovarusso@unisa.it).
