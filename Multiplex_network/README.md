## On the design of integral multiplex control protocols in nonlinear network systems with delays
### Introduction
This repository collects the supporting code for the manuscript **On the design of integral multiplex control protocols in nonlinear network systems with delays** (arXiv link). In the manuscript, we designed a distributed integral control protocol for a network system in the form of multiplex architecture to *reject polynomial disturbances* and proposed sufficient conditions to guarantee *scalability* of the network system with regard to the residual disturbances.
