## Robotarium
This folder contains the code/data for robotarium experimental validation with necessary supplementary materials to run them.

The *init.m* initialises the Robotarium simulator and should be ran before running any other code from this folder.

To get the figure in the manuscript, run *robotarium_validation.m*.
