# On Action Composition for Autonomous Sequential Decision-Making

### Introduction
A growing paradigm in stochastic control is that of obtaining policies from a pool of experts or sources. In the paper _On Action Composition for Autonomous Sequential Decision-Making_ this idea is expounded upon by allowing an agent to merge such sources to obtain its behaviors (arXiv link pending). This repository contains the code used to perform the simulation experiments supporting the paper.
