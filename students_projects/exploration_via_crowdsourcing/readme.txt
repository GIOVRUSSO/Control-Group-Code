Data-driven control project.
There are three versions of the algorithm in the repository, each of which has a dedicated chapter of the report.
To execute the script you need to have python installed on the machine, enter a project folder and execute the "agent_v * .py" file where * differs according to the versions.
The final version of the algorithm comes with a graphic simulator automatically imported into the main script (there is also a new version that marks the target cell).
An example of shell execution is:
$> python agent_v1.5.py
