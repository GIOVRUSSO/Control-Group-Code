# Rover Navigation in Unstructured Environment

## Overview

This project is focusing on the development of an autonomous rover navigation system for unstructured environments by exploiting Data Driven techniques. The system integrates several ROS-based tools and algorithms for localization, obstacle detection, path planning, and control. It leverages multiple sensors, dynamic models, and simulation environments using Gazebo.

### Key Features:
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Waypoint-based navigation with path adjustments in response to dynamic obstacles.
- **Sensor Fusion**: Localization using GPS, IMU, and LiDAR sensors, integrating data with an EKF-based fusion system. #TODO key files for this function.
- **Multi-Robot Simulation**: Integration of multiple Husky rovers in a Gazebo environment with real-time obstacle detection. #TODO key files for this features
- **Teleoperation**: Manual control interface for teleoperating the rover using a keyboard.
- **Extraction of passive dynamics from teleoperation data**: teleoperation facility can be used for generating trajectories which can be taken into account as example data or passive dynamics by the control algorithm for the planning phase.

14. **Trajectory and Dataset Management**:
    - **`data_combiner.ipynb`**: A notebook used to merge recorded trajectories into a dataset.
    - **`log_position_xxxxxxx_xxxxxx`**: Numpy arrays storing sample trajectories generated through teleoperation.
15. **Teleoperation user interface**
    - **`keyboard_husky.py`**: it allows to control the rover using the keyboard. In particular, you just need to press W,A,S,D respectively for going forawd, turning to left, going backward, turning right.
16. **Multi-robot integration**
    - **`multi_husky_rovers`**: folder where are contained launch files configured for spawning, localizing and controlling multiple Husky rovers in Gazebo. Each rover is equipped with GPS,IMU, LiDAR VLP-16 and odometry. All sensors are simulated but is easy to add gaussian noise (through urdf) in order to emulate more realistic scenarios.
17. **Performance evaluation**
    -**`evaluate_performance.py`**: aUse it to assess the performance of the control algorithms, focusing on trajectory tracking accuracy and obstacle avoidance efficiency.
