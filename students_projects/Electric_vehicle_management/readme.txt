Project on the design of an intelligent transportation system able to manage the electric battery of hybrid vehicles and to find optimal routes via crowdsourcing.
In this project a real map was created in Sumo, in particular a portion of the city of Naples. The focus of the work was two, managing the battery of a hybrid vehicle and calculating the best route with crowdsourcing.
The part of the code that we find with the name of "Napoli.py" in the "Battery_Management" folder tests the functioning of the battery management problem applied to 28% of vehicles out of the total number of vehicles participating in the simulation, which are 5950.
The optimization is done offline so the other files are the individual optimizations for traffic flows composed of hybrid vehicles.
The "Pollution_Function" folder contains the files that have been used to calculate the pollution function of the single vehicle which gives C02 emissions as the vehicle speed varies.
Finally, the heart of the thesis work which is that in which a vehicle must calculate the best route through a crowdsourcing algorithm which is located in the "Lavoro_Tesi_Crowdsourcing" folder. This folder contains the code in which a hybrid vehicle that enters the simulation calculates the best route to reach its destination by optimizing battery management online.
