This folder contains the files needed to run the simulations for Scenario $2$.

### To run the code
To run these simulation, one needs a working SUMO and TraCI installation. Then, first clone the repository, and extract _salerno\_net.zip_ into a folder with the same name. Then, generate the simulation files with _Simulation\_launcher.ipynb_ (see lower) and start the simulation.
