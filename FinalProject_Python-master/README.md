**The code files in this repository is for downloading the interesting data files from particular Dropbox, save those data with new formatting after processing the raw data, and plot graphs to find the relationship between each.**

If you want the code for: 


downloading E4 files: **HeartBeatRateData.ipynb**                                                
                      **SkinConductanceData.ipynb**

downloading Ebike files: **EBike.ipynb**

plotting to find the relationship between human-health related variables and Human Power: **DataPlotting.ipynb**

## I wrote the separate code for downloading each inserted data file is because it is handier to debug if there is any exception occurs.


Draft Q-learning code: **QLearning.ipynb**

## This code builds an initialized Q-table and gives an idea about how to mark the reward for each action as well as how to get the next state.
