# ON CONVEX DATA-DRIVEN INVERSE OPTIMAL CONTROL FOR NONLINEAR, NON-STATIONARY AND STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS
### Introduction
This repository collects the supporting code for the manuscript **ON CONVEX DATA-DRIVEN INVERSE OPTIMAL CONTROL FOR NONLINEAR, NON-STATIONARY AND STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS** ([see this link]()). The manuscript addresses a finite-horizon inverse control problem, wherein the objective is to infer the possibly non-convex and non-stationary cost driving the actions of an agent from observations.  For this inverse problem, we present a solution by solving an convex optimization problem estimating the cost even when in the cases where: (i) the cost is not convex; (ii) the underlying dynamics is nonlinear, non-stationary and stochastic. Our approach relies on the maximum likelihood principle. Additionally, we tackle a forward control problem involving randomized policies as decision variables. For this forward problem, we derive an explicit expression for the optimal solution. We turn our results into algorithmic procedures, and  show the effectiveness of our approach via both in-silico and experimental validations with a physical hardware set-up.
