These are the code and applied parameters for the work 'Scalability in nonlinear network systems affected by delays and disturbances'.
(1). File 'Neural_network_scalability.m' simulates the scalability for a hopfield neural network with applied parameters given in files 'u.csv' and 'w2.csv'.
(2). File 'Robotic_formation_scalability.m' simulates a robotic formation scalability example.
(3). File 'upper_boundvs_increasingdelay.m' plots the upper bound of the state deviation for the robots formation scalability with increasing delay.
