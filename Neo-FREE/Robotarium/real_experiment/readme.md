In this folder there is the code for the real-hardware experiment to be submitted to the Robotarium platform.

One of the experiments simulated for the proceeding *Neo-FREE: Policy Composition Through Thousand Brains And Free Energy Optimization* is run.
Specifically, the unicycle robot is driven from the initial position $x_0=[1.2, 0.6]^{\top}$ to the goal position $x_d=[-1.4, 0]^{\top}$ by using the Neo-FREE algorithm.

The resulting video of the real-hardware experiment is shown here:

(*Note*: the video does not show the obstacles because of technical issues with the Robotarium projector during the last few weeks.
It is going to be replaced in the next days and the complete video will be uploaded right after.)
