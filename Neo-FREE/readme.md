# Neo-FREE: Policy Composition Through Thousand Brains And Free Energy Optimization

This repository contains the Python code developed for the proceeding ***Neo-FREE: Policy Composition Through Thousand Brains And Free Energy Optimization***.
The application involves the navigation of a unicycle robot from the Robotarium [[1]](#1) in an environment with obstacles. Specifically:
- The folder *simulations* contains the code for the simulated environment;
- The folder *real_experiment* contains the code developed for the real-hardware simulation, which can be reproduced by uploading on the Robotarium webpage.

The Python simulator for Robotarium is available at https://github.com/robotarium/robotarium_python_simulator.

The following dependencies are required for the simulations:
- NumPy (http://www.numpy.org)
- matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org/index.html)
- CVXPY (https://www.cvxpy.org)
- SciPy (https://scipy.org).
